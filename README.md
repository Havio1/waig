# WAIG: Where Am I Going
Fabric mod for Minecraft, adds a minimal RPG-inspired compass HUD to the game

![Demo Image](demo.gif)

TODO:
- [x] implement
- [x] image for GH
- [ ] move just under boss bar
- [ ] make toggleable
- [ ] make public
- [ ] maybe: make configurable so that it is only visible when compass held/in inventory
